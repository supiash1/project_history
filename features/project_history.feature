#   Scenario: Viewing the history of a project's status changes
#     Given I am logged in as a user
#       And I am on the projects page
#       And I have a project named "Project A" with a status of "In Progress" and comments "This is a test project"
#     When I go to the history page for "Project A"
#     Then I should see the history of status changes for "Project A"
#       And I should see the status "In Progress" with comments "This is a test project"
